        <h2>We have found an easier way to learn languages</h2>
        <p>
            Here's the thing...<br><br>
            Many of us know someone who is struggling to learn a language (well maybe that's you).
            Now it doesnt matter the reasoning; whether they are doing it to communicate better with a significant other
            or simply to look more educated.
            The fact is that the language barrier is quite difficult to overcome quickly.

            But what if I told you there was a better way, an easier way to stop stressing about all the languages you
            need to be learning.
            Instead of showing up to classes at a community college or wasting your battery on <a
                href="duolingo.com">duolingo</a> every day, what
            if you could simply open up your browser and it would do the rest of the work for you?
            (well... mostly)<br><br>

            Since this question is so widely asked around the world, we have finally come up with a solution for
            it.

            <p>
                Trate is an amazing new application which allows you to passively learn languages while you work on other projects.
                To help you understand more, it is quite similar to a popular translate app <em>(which we cant say the name of for legal reasons).</em>
                Just pull up the app on an extra monitor or TV which you can see from your work station, and put it into full-screen mode.

            <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
            <p>
                Once enabled, Trate will be listening to words you say in the background.
                All you have to do is say the word out loud, and Trait will show you the translated word on the screen.
                Need to disable the microphone for a bit? Just simply say the <em>'mute'</em> keyword and it will pause functionality.
                Need to change the delay time between word resets? Simply say the <em>'settings'</em> keyword and you will be brought to the settings.
