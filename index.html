        <li>What is the easiest way to passively learn a language?</li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Many of us know someone (or are that exact person) who is struggling to learn a language.
                Now it doesnt matter the reasoning; whether they are doing it to communicate better with a significant other or simply to look more educated.
                The fact is that the language barrier is quite the barrier when it is someone you love. <br><br>

                But what if I told you there was a better way, an easier way to stop stressing about all the languages you need to be learning.
                Instead of showing up to classes at a community college or wasting your battery on duolingo every day, what if you could simply open up your browser and it would do the rest of the work for you?
                (well... mostly)<br><br>

                Since this question is so widely asked around the world, we have finally come up with a solution for it.
                We will be working with this initial question and then creating an app that lives up to each and every promise previously stated. <br><br>
                
                Stay tuned.
